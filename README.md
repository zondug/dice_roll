# Physics-based 2D Dice Rolling

A physics-based dice rolling simulator created with Godot Engine (v4.3). Trying to make a realistic dice rolling and dynamic face changes.

## Features

### Physics-Based Rolling
- Realistic dice movement using Godot's physics engine
- Multiple dice support (default: 5 dice)
- Natural bouncing and collision effects
- Smooth deceleration and stopping

### Dice Mechanics
- Dynamic face changes during rolling
- Scale animation when throwing dice
- Randomized throwing force and direction

Made with Godot Engine.
