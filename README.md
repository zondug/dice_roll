# Physics-based 2D Dice Rolling

A physics-based dice rolling simulator created with Godot Engine (v4.3). Experience realistic dice rolling with multiple dice and dynamic face changes.

## Features

### Physics-Based Rolling
- Realistic dice movement using Godot's physics engine
- Multiple dice support (default: 5 dice)
- Natural bouncing and collision effects
- Smooth deceleration and stopping

### Dice Mechanics
- Four unique dice faces:
  - Attack
  - Shield
  - Skill
  - Magic
- Dynamic face changes during rolling
- Scale animation when throwing dice
- Randomized throwing force and direction

### Visual Effects
- Smooth dice face transitions
- Dynamic scale animations during throws
- Realistic movement and rotation
- Confined rolling area with walls

### Interactive Elements
- Reset button to start new rolls
- Multiple dice rolled simultaneously
- Independent physics for each die

Made with Godot Engine, this project demonstrates the implementation of 2D physics, sprite management, and animation systems to create an engaging dice rolling experience.
